# 🧮 Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

Welcome to the **DSA Practice** repository — a focused environment for implementing, revisiting, and refining key data structures and algorithms using Python and C. This repository complements my broader Cloud Computing roadmap by reinforcing essential computational thinking and problem-solving strategies required in systems-level and backend development.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Solidify knowledge of fundamental data structures and core algorithms
- Rebuild implementations from scratch in Python and C
- Solve categorized problems from platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank
- Create **mini-projects** that show real-world applications of DSA

---

## 📚 Theory Coverage

Inside the `/theory` folder:
- 🔹 Arrays, Strings, Pointers
- 🔹 Linked Lists (singly, doubly, circular)
- 🔹 Stacks, Queues, Heaps
- 🔹 Trees (BST, AVL, N-ary), Tries
- 🔹 Graphs (BFS, DFS, weighted/unweighted)
- 🔹 Recursion, Backtracking
- 🔹 Sorting (quick, merge, radix), Searching (binary, DFS/BFS)
- 🔹 Dynamic Programming & Greedy techniques

---

## 💻 Practice Exercises

The `/practice` folder includes:
- Implementations of each data structure
- Algorithmic challenges by category
- Solved problems from:
  - LeetCode (easy/medium/hard)
  - HackerRank
  - GeeksForGeeks

All implementations are well-commented and organized by language and topic.

---

## 🚀 Projects

The `/projects` folder includes small, focused apps that apply DSA principles:
- 📌 Heap-based task scheduler
- 📌 Trie-powered autocomplete engine
- 📌 Graph-based shortest path explorer
- 📌 Text indexer using hash tables

Each project includes:
- `README.md` with problem statement and usage
- Input/output examples
- Benchmark results or performance analysis

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- `Python` (problem-solving, algorithm design)
- `C` (manual memory management, low-level efficiency)
- `Graphviz` or `Matplotlib` for visualizing data structures (optional)

## 📎 Notes

This repository will grow over time as I continue solving problems and building efficient, testable components. It is designed to support **interview readiness**, **competitive programming**, and **systems-level thinking**.

Feel free to explore and contribute ideas or problems worth tackling!
